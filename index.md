I have [worked](http://www.linkedin.com/in/walterlark) at several startups, Walmart, Next Big Sound, Microsoft, and Apple, and received a B.S. in Computer Science from Brown University. In my spare time I enjoy taking [photos](http://instagram.com/walter.lark) and writing [code](http://github.com/wb).
